            <h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF SOFT SKILLS<br>Â¿What are they, their value and how to develop them?</h1>
            <p class="small-text">Sofia I. Rodriguez Cura</p>
            <p class="main-paragraph">Soft skills are personal attributes, behaviors, and social attitudes that enable individuals to interact effectively with others in various environments, including the workplace or in learning environments. 
                They encompass abilities such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Unlike hard skills, which are technical and job-specific, soft skills are broadly applicable across different roles and industries.<br><br>
                These skills are essential for building healthy relationships, facilitating effective communication, and fostering collaboration. They are also referred to as interpersonal or people skills and are crucial for professional success.<br><br>
                Employers highly value soft skills because they contribute to a harmonious and productive work environment. Attributes such as adaptability, organization, open-mindedness, problem-solving abilities, and a strong work ethic are particularly sought after.<br><br>
                In summary, soft skills are non-technical abilities that relate to how you work and interact with others. They include emotional intelligence, communication abilities such as conflict resolution, interpersonal skills like cultural sensitivity or leadership, and other personal attributes that enhance an individual's interactions and performance. You can find more information on the topics mentioned, as well as general tips, linked on the right.</p>
